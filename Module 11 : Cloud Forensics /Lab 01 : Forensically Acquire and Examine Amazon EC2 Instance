🎯 Objective
During a security incident involving an AWS EC2 instance, forensic investigators must preserve evidence without altering 
the suspect system.

The goal of this lab is to:
Acquire an offline forensic snapshot of an EC2 instance’s EBS volume, convert it into an evidence volume, attach it 
to a forensic workstation, and verify file integrity after a simulated insider tampering attack.

🧰 Tools Used
AWS EC2 & Elastic Block Store (EBS)
PuTTY & PuTTYgen
FTK Imager
MD5 Hash Calculator

📌 Scenario Overview

A confidential file is uploaded to a production EC2 instance by a legitimate user.
A malicious insider modifies the file content.

A forensic investigator:
Takes the suspect system offline
Acquires a forensic snapshot
Creates an evidence volume
Mounts it on a forensic workstation
Validates file tampering using cryptographic hashes

🧪 Procedure
🔹 Task 1 – Creating EC2 Instances

Created two instances:
Instance	Purpose
Production Machine	Suspect system
Forensic Workstation	Evidence analysis
Generated RSA key pair (.pem) and converted it to .ppk using PuTTYgen.

🔹 Task 2 – Uploading Confidential File
Transferred quote.txt into production instance using:
pscp -i AWSproductionmachinekey.ppk quote.txt ubuntu@<public_dns>:/home/ubuntu/

🔹 Task 3 – Insider File Tampering
Connected via PuTTY and modified file contents:
sudo -i
cd /home/ubuntu
nano quote.txt

🔹 Task 4 – Forensic Evidence Acquisition
✅ Proper forensic handling:
Production instance stopped
Root EBS volume identified
Snapshot created
Evidence volume created from snapshot

🔹 Task 5 – Mounting Evidence Volume
Stopped forensic workstation
Attached evidence volume (xvdf)
Restarted forensic workstation
Confirmed mounted device

🔹 Task 6 – Evidence Examination with FTK Imager
Steps:
Open FTK Imager
Add attached physical drive
Navigate:
PHYSICALDRIVE1 → Partition → ext4 → root → home → ubuntu
Located quote.txt
Exported hash values

🔍 Integrity Verification
Hash of tampered file obtained from evidence volume
Compared with original file hash using MD5 calculator
Hash mismatch confirmed unauthorized modification

🔍 Findings
✔ Evidence preserved without altering suspect system
✔ File content modification confirmed
✔ Forensic snapshot preserved point-in-time state
✔ Cloud-native evidence acquisition achieved
✔ Integrity breach clearly demonstrated

📚 Lessons Learned
Cloud evidence must be acquired offline to preserve integrity
EBS snapshots act as forensic disk images in AWS
Evidence volumes allow safe analysis without contamination
Cryptographic hashes are essential for tampering detection
Forensic methodology applies equally to cloud environments
