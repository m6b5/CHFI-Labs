## 🎯 Objective
- Compare hashes of suspect files with pre-existing values to verify file integrity  
- Generate MD5 hash values of selected files using MD5 Calculator  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **MD5 Calculator** – computes MD5 hash values of files to check integrity  

## 📌 Procedure
1. Select a suspicious file for analysis  
2. Use MD5 Calculator to compute the file's MD5 hash  
3. Record the output hash value  
4. Compare the computed hash with the previously known hash  

## 🔍 Findings
- If the hashes do not match, the file’s integrity is compromised and further investigation is required  
- The file may have been modified to hide data, deliver a payload, or evade detection  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Hashing is a fundamental forensic technique for verifying file integrity and detecting tampering  
- Recording hash values is essential for maintaining a verifiable chain of digital evidence
