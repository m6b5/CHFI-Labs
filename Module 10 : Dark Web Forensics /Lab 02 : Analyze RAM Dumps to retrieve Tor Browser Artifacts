## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze a system RAM dump to uncover Tor Browser activity  
- Extract volatile forensic artifacts related to web usage and communications  
- Understand how memory forensics supports Dark Web investigations  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Bulk Extractor** – memory and disk artifact extraction tool  

## 📌 Procedure

1. Create two folders on the Desktop:
   - **Tor_Report_Browser_Open**
   - **Tor_Report_Browser_Closed**

2. Install and launch Bulk Extractor  

3. Click **Generate a Report Using bulk_extractor**

4. Select:
   - RAM image file (e.g., `example.mem`)  
   - Output directory: `Tor_Report_Browser_Open`

5. Ensure all scanner options are enabled  

6. Click **Submit Run** and wait for scan completion  

7. After scan completes, open Bulk Extractor Viewer  

8. Analyze extracted artifact files including:
   - `domain.txt` — visited domains  
   - `email.txt` — email addresses found in memory  
   - `url.txt` — accessed URLs  
   - `url_searches.txt` — search queries performed  

9. Repeat the same process using output directory:
   - `Tor_Report_Browser_Closed`
 

## 🔍 Findings
- Memory dumps contained recoverable Tor Browser browsing artifacts  
- Domains, URLs, email addresses, and search queries were successfully extracted   
- Volatile memory holds sensitive forensic evidence often missed in disk analysis  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- RAM forensics is critical for investigating privacy-focused applications like Tor  
- Volatile memory preserves real-time user activity and communication traces  
- Bulk Extractor efficiently extracts actionable forensic artifacts  
- Combining memory and disk analysis strengthens investigative conclusions
