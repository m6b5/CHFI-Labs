## 🎯 Objective
- Examine Windows Prefetch files to identify application execution history  
- Analyze Prefetch data related to Tor Browser activity  
- Learn how to retrieve evidence of Tor Browser usage on a Windows system through:
  - Prefetch file analysis  
  - Network connection monitoring  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **WinPrefetchView** – Windows Prefetch file analysis tool  
- **netstat** – built-in Windows network monitoring utility  

## 📌 Procedure

1. Install Tor Browser on the system  
2. Install and launch WinPrefetchView  
3. Locate Tor Browser Prefetch entries (e.g., `TOR.EXE`, `FIREFOX.EXE`)  
4. Right-click the Prefetch entry and select **Properties**  
5. Review metadata including:
   - Filename  
   - Created time  
   - Modified time  
   - Last run time  
   - Run counter  
   - Execution path  

6. Launch Tor Browser  

7. Open Command Prompt with administrator privileges and run:
netstat -ano


8. Observe active connections and associated ports related to Tor activity  

## 🔍 Findings
- Prefetch metadata provides execution timelines of Tor Browser usage  
- Tor Browser typically communicates through ports **9150/9151**  
- Network states observed:
- **ESTABLISHED** – active connection  
- **LISTENING** – waiting for incoming connections  
- These artifacts confirm Dark Web browser activity on the system  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Windows Prefetch files are valuable artifacts for application execution analysis  
- Even privacy-focused browsers leave forensic traces on host systems  
- Network monitoring helps validate suspicious software activity  
- Timeline correlation strengthens forensic evidence
