## 🎯 Objective
- Perform forensic analysis on suspicious email messages  
- Identify spoofing, phishing, and unsafe redirection techniques  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **SysTools EML Viewer** – email forensic analysis tool  
- **whatismyipaddress.com** – IP address investigation  
- **centralops.net** – email header and domain analysis  

## 📌 Procedure (Key Steps)

1. Open suspicious `.eml` file using SysTools EML Viewer  

2. Analyze email body in **HTML view**:
   - Inspect embedded links and redirection behavior  
   - Identify mismatched URLs, private IP usage, and lack of HTTPS  

3. Open **Message Header** tab  

4. Examine **Message-ID** field:
   - Check domain after `@` symbol for legitimacy  

5. Review **Received** headers:
   - Trace email routing path  
   - Identify spoofed or localhost origins  

6. Analyze **Received-SPF** field:
   - Verify sender authentication status  

7. Use online tools:
   - Validate IP addresses and domains for suspicious activity  

## 🔍 Findings
- Suspicious email used misleading hyperlinks with private IP redirection  
- Message-ID contained `localhost` instead of legitimate domain  
- Received headers confirmed spoofed origin  
- Normal email showed proper fully qualified domain (e.g., mail.gmail.com)  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Email header analysis is essential for identifying spoofing and phishing  
- Mismatched URLs and insecure links are strong scam indicators  
- Message-ID and SPF records help validate email authenticity  
- Combining header analysis with link inspection strengthens investigations
