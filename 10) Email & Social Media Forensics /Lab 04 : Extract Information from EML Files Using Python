## 🎯 Objective
- Gain hands-on experience in forensic investigation techniques using Python  
- Extract key information from `.eml` email files programmatically  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python** (with libraries such as `email`, `imaplib`, or `pyzmail`)  

## 📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
1. Load the target `.eml` file using Python  
2. Parse the email using the `email` library:
   - Extract **From**, **To**, **CC**, **BCC** fields  
   - Extract **Subject** and **Date/Time**  
3. Access the email body (plain text and HTML formats)  
4. Extract attachments and save them locally  
5. Optionally, validate URLs or links found in the email body  
6. Store the extracted data in a structured format (CSV or JSON) for reporting  

## 🔍 Findings
- Python scripts allow rapid extraction of email metadata and contents  
- Attachments, URLs, and message headers can be analyzed automatically  
- Automated extraction reduces manual effort in large investigations  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Python is a powerful tool for automating email forensic investigations  
- Script-based analysis helps handle large volumes of emails efficiently  
- Combining programming with DFIR skills adds a professional edge to investigations
