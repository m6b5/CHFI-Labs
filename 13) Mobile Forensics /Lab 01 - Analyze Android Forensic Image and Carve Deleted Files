## 🎯 Objective
- Recover deleted data from a mobile device, which may contain critical evidence  
- Acquire a dd image of the device contents and analyze it for evidence  
- Gain hands-on experience in file carving from hex code and various file types  
- Understand the process of retrieving deleted information in the absence of a filesystem  
- Examine an image file obtained from an Android device and recover deleted data  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Autopsy** – digital forensics platform for analyzing disk and mobile images  

## 📌 Procedure
1. Open the acquired mobile image in Autopsy  
2. Select any carved file and use tabs such as **File Metadata, Hex, Text, and Annotations** to view associated data  
3. Expand **File Views → Deleted Files**, and select **All** to display all recovered deleted files  
4. Select a deleted file (e.g., `AU-WP1.JPG`) and inspect its data under the **Application** tab  
5. Review files classified by size: 50–200 MB, 200 MB–1 GB, and 1 GB+  
6. Examine cache memory files displayed in Autopsy under the **Cache** section  
7. Investigate the **OrphanFiles** directory under `Android_Device_Evidence.E01`, which contains partially recovered or broken files  
8. Use the **Timeline** feature (**Tools → Timeline**) to retrieve information on events that occurred on the device during a selected time period  

## 🔍 Findings
- Autopsy displays all filesystem events and recovered deleted files  
- File carving allows retrieval of critical evidence even when the original filesystem no longer exists  
- Timeline analysis provides chronological insight into device activity  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Mobile device images can be analyzed thoroughly using forensic tools  
- File carving and timeline analysis are essential skills for mobile forensic investigations  
- Proper documentation of recovered files is critical for maintaining evidence integrity
