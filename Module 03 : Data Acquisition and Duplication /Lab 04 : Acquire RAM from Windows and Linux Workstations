🎯 Objective
Understand the importance of volatile memory in digital forensics and learn how to:
Acquire RAM from live systems without shutting them down
Perform memory acquisition on both Windows and Linux workstations
Use local and remote memory acquisition techniques
RAM contains critical artifacts such as:
Running processes
Network connections
Encryption keys
Malware in execution

🧰 Tools Used
Windows:
Belkasoft RAM Capturer

Linux:
fmem kernel module
LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)
dd
Netcat

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🪟 Windows RAM Acquisition (Belkasoft RAM Capturer)
Step 1 — Launch Tool
Executed RamCapture64.exe as administrator

Step 2 — Storage Preparation
Selected forensic disk (F:)
Created folder: Windows RAM

Step 3 — Capture Memory
Started RAM acquisition
Dump saved as:
YYYYMMDD.mem
➡ Live memory successfully captured without powering off the system.

🐧 Linux RAM Acquisition — fmem (Local)
Step 1 — Prepare Environment
Installed required build tools:
apt install -y build-essential
apt install -y dwarves
Copied kernel file:
cp /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux /usr/lib/modules/6.2.0-35-generic/build/

Compiled and installed fmem:
make
bash run.sh

Step 2 — Local RAM Dump with dd
dd if=/dev/fmem of=/home/james/ubuntu_local_ram.dd bs=1MB
➡ Full memory dump stored locally.

🔥 Linux RAM Acquisition — LiME (Local)
Step 1 — Build LiME
cd /home/james/LiME/src/
make

Step 2 — Load Kernel Module & Dump Memory
insmod lime-6.2.0-35-generic.ko "path=../../ubuntu_local_ram.mem format=lime"
➡ Memory captured in LiME forensic format.

🌐 Linux RAM Acquisition — Remote (dd + Netcat)
📡 On Forensic Machine (Listener)
nc -l 1234 > ubuntu_remote_ram.dd

🖥 On Suspect Machine (Sender)
dd if=/dev/fmem bs=1024 | nc 10.10.1.9 1234
➡ RAM transmitted securely and stored remotely.

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully captured live RAM from Windows and Linux systems
✔ Performed both local and remote memory acquisition
✔ Preserved volatile forensic artifacts
✔ Demonstrated enterprise DFIR acquisition techniques

📚 Lessons Learned
RAM contains crucial volatile evidence missed by disk analysis
Live acquisition prevents data loss
Linux kernel modules enable deep memory extraction
Remote acquisition is valuable when storage access is limited
Memory forensics is essential in malware investigations
