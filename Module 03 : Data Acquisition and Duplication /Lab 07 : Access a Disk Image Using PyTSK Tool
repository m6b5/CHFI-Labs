🎯 Objective
Learn how to programmatically analyze forensic disk images to:
Parse file systems within disk images
Enumerate directories and files
Access evidence without mounting the image
Automate forensic investigations using Python
This method is widely used in large-scale forensic analysis and incident response automation.

🧰 Tools Used
PyTSK (Python bindings for The Sleuth Kit)
Python 3

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
📁 Step 1 — Prepare Evidence Image
Copied forensic image:
XX.img
into the Home directory for analysis.

🛠 Step 2 — Install PyTSK Library
Acquired root privileges:
sudo su
Installed PyTSK:
pip install pytsk3

🧾 Step 3 — Create Analysis Script
Created Python script:
gedit disk_analysis.py

Script logic:
Opens disk image
Loads file system
Iterates directories
Prints file and folder names

▶ Step 4 — Execute Forensic Analysis
Ran script:
python3 disk_analysis.py

Automatically displayed:
File structure
Directories
Associated artifacts within disk image

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully parsed disk image using Python
✔ Enumerated all directories and files
✔ Accessed forensic evidence without mounting
✔ Demonstrated automated forensic workflow

📚 Lessons Learned
Disk images can be analyzed programmatically
Automation speeds large forensic cases
PyTSK enables scalable evidence parsing
Python is powerful for DFIR tooling
