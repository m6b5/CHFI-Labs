🎯 Objective
Perform a forensic-sound physical acquisition of a Windows system drive by:
Creating a raw disk image using the dd tool
Storing evidence on an external medium
Verifying integrity using cryptographic hashing
This lab demonstrates proper evidence acquisition procedures used in digital forensics investigations.

🧰 Tools Used
dd for Windows (disk imaging utility)
Windows PowerShell (Administrator mode)
External storage device (USB drive for evidence storage)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔍 Step 1 — Identify Physical Disk
Opened PowerShell as Administrator and listed available disks:
wmic diskdrive list brief /format:list
➡ Identified target disk (e.g., PHYSICALDRIVE0) for acquisition.

📂 Step 2 — Prepare Evidence Storage
Navigated to dd executable directory:
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\dd

Mounted external USB storage:
net use Z: "\\USB"

Created evidence directory:
Z:\Evidence

💽 Step 3 — Acquire Disk Image
Executed physical acquisition command:
.\dd.exe if=\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 of=Z:\Evidence\Windows_Evidence_001.dd bs=512k --size --progress

Parameters explained:
if → input physical drive
of → output forensic image
bs=512k → block size for efficiency
--progress → acquisition monitoring
➡ Generated a raw forensic disk image for investigation.

🔐 Step 4 — Verify Evidence Integrity (Hashing)
Computed MD5 hash of the acquired image:
Get-FileHash Z:\Evidence\Windows_Evidence_001.dd -Algorithm MD5 | Format-List
➡ Ensures evidence integrity and chain-of-custody validation.

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully acquired full physical disk image
✔ Evidence securely stored on external medium
✔ Cryptographic hash generated for integrity verification

📚 Lessons Learned
Physical disk acquisition preserves all data including deleted files and slack space
External storage prevents contamination of the suspect system
Hash verification is critical for forensic admissibility
DD provides raw, tool-agnostic forensic images usable across platforms
