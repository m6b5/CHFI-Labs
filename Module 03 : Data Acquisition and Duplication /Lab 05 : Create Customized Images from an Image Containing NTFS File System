🎯 Objective
Understand how the Windows NTFS (New Technology File System) stores data at the sector level and learn how to:
Examine raw NTFS disk structures
Analyze sectors in hexadecimal format
Identify partitions and file system metadata
Extract low-level evidence for forensic processing
NTFS supports:
File permissions
Encryption (EFS)
Compression
Hidden data streams
➡ Making it critical in digital forensic investigations.

🧰 Tools Used
DiskExplorer for NTFS

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🧩 Step 1 — Load Forensic Image
Launched DiskExplorer for NTFS
Selected File → Open as Drive
Loaded forensic image:
XX.dd

DiskExplorer displayed:
Valid sectors
Partition table structure

➡ Confirmed proper NTFS disk layout.

🔢 Step 2 — Sector-Level Navigation
Opened raw sector view:
Goto → Sector
Entered hex offset:
00000004
Switched view:
View → Hex   (or F3)

➡ Displayed raw NTFS sector data in hexadecimal format.

📋 Step 3 — Evidence Extraction
Selected full hex content:
Edit → Select All
Exported evidence:
Edit → Copy to File
Saved sector data for:
Timeline analysis
Metadata reconstruction
Court-ready documentation

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully navigated raw NTFS disk sectors
✔ Viewed partition and filesystem structures
✔ Extracted low-level hexadecimal evidence
✔ Demonstrated forensic disk interpretation beyond file browsing

📚 Lessons Learned
NTFS stores critical forensic metadata at sector level
Hex analysis reveals hidden & deleted artifacts
Forensic tools allow deep file system inspection
Low-level disk analysis strengthens evidence reliability
