🎯 Objective
Understand and perform forensic image format conversion by:
Converting E01 (EnCase Evidence File) into RAW/DD format
Preserving bit-level integrity of acquired evidence
Enabling compatibility with multiple forensic tools
This lab demonstrates proper handling of forensic image formats commonly encountered in investigations.

🧰 Tools Used
xmount (forensic image mounting and conversion utility)
Linux terminal (Ubuntu)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
📥 Step 1 — Install xmount
Updated repositories and installed the tool:
sudo apt-get install -y xmount

📂 Step 2 — Prepare Mount Directory
Created an empty directory for the converted image:
mkdir /home/jason/Documents/e01_mount
⚠️ The mount directory must be empty before use.

🔄 Step 3 — Convert E01 to DD Format
Executed conversion command:
xmount --in ewf XX.E01 /home/jason/Documents/e01_mount


Explanation:
--in ewf → specifies EnCase (E01) input format
XX.E01 → source forensic image
Mount directory → output location
➡ The E01 image is mounted and exposed as a RAW/DD disk image.

📦 Step 4 — Access Converted Image
Navigated to mount directory:
cd /home/jason/Documents/e01_mount
ls
➡ RAW disk image available for analysis by forensic tools.

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully converted E01 forensic image to DD format
✔ Maintained bit-for-bit integrity
✔ Enabled compatibility with tools requiring raw disk images

📚 Lessons Learned
E01 is a compressed forensic format with metadata support
DD/RAW is a universal format supported by most forensic tools
xmount allows safe, read-only forensic image handling
Format conversion improves tool interoperability in investigation
