🎯 Objective
Understand how to safely mount forensic disk images on a Linux forensic workstation in order to:
Access evidence without modifying original data
Support multiple file systems and image formats
Perform live forensic analysis on acquired images

This lab covers:
Mounting RAW/DD images using the mount command
Mounting disk images using loop devices (losetup)

🧰 Tools Used
Ubuntu Linux forensic workstation
Built-in Linux utilities (mount, losetup)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
📂 Step 1 — Mount DD Image Using mount (Read-Only)
Created a mount directory:
sudo mkdir /mnt/dd
Mounted the forensic image in read-only mode:
sudo mount -o ro /home/jason/Documents/Windows_Evidence_001.dd /mnt/dd

🔍 Step 2 — View Mounted Evidence
Listed contents of the image:
ls -la /mnt/dd/
➡ Allowed safe examination of files within the forensic image.

🔁 Step 3 — Identify Available Loop Device
Checked for unused loop devices:
sudo losetup -f
Example output:
/dev/loop14

🍎 Step 4 — Mount Mac File System Image Using Loop Device
Attached Mac forensic image to loop device:
sudo losetup /dev/loop14 MAC_Evidence_001.dd
The mounted image appeared automatically on the system.
Opened the mounted volume to view contents.
💡 To show hidden files:
Ctrl + H

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully mounted Windows and macOS forensic images
✔ Preserved evidence using read-only access
✔ Accessed hidden forensic artifacts
✔ Demonstrated multi-filesystem support on Linux

📚 Lessons Learned
Forensic images must always be mounted in read-only mode
Linux provides native tools for evidence handling
Loop devices allow mounting complex disk structures
Hidden files often contain valuable forensic evidence
Mounted images are the foundation for forensic analysi
