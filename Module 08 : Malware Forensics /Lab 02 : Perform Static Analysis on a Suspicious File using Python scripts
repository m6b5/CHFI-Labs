🎯 Objective
Use Python scripts to automate forensic analysis of a suspicious executable by:
Generating cryptographic file fingerprints (hashes)
Extracting PE file structure and metadata
Identifying linked libraries and dependencies
Performing string extraction to uncover indicators of compromise

🧰 Tools Used
Ubuntu Linux
Python 3
pefile library
Custom Python analysis scripts

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔐 Step 1 – File Fingerprinting (Hashing)
Used Python to generate:
MD5
SHA-1
SHA-256

Purpose:
Verify file integrity
Compare with malware databases (VirusTotal, threat intel feeds)
Track malware variants

🧱 Step 2 – PE File Structure Analysis
Installed PE parsing library: pip install pefile
Analyzed executable using pefile script to extract:
Section names
Entry point
Entropy values
Exported symbols
API references
Suspicious anomalies

Investigation focus included:
Abnormal section names
High entropy (possible obfuscation)
Suspicious API imports
Known malware indicators

🔗 Step 3 – Dependency Analysis
Executed:
file_dependencies.py
Purpose:
Identify DLLs and modules used by the malware
Understand runtime behavior and required system access

Outcome:
Revealed system libraries tied to file operations, registry access, and networking

🧵 Step 4 – String Extraction Using Python
Ran Python script to extract readable strings from the executable.

Key value of strings:
Hardcoded IP addresses & URLs
Registry paths
File names
Command-line instructions
Persistence indicators

🔍 Findings
Hashing provides reliable malware identification and tracking
PE analysis exposes suspicious structure and execution flow
Dependencies reveal system-level access patterns
String extraction uncovers clear indicators of compromise (IOCs)

➡️ Python automation significantly speeds up malware forensic investigations.

📚 Lessons Learned
Hashing is foundational in digital forensics and malware classification
Python is powerful for automating repetitive forensic tasks
PE structure reveals hidden behavior without execution
Strings often directly expose attacker infrastructure
Combining tools + scripts improves investigation efficiency
