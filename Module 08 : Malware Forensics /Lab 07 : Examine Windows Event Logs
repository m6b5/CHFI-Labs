🎯 Objective
Understand how to examine Windows Event Logs to identify suspicious or anomalous activities related to:
Process creation
File/object access
Network connections
Deletion of critical objects

This lab demonstrates how attackers leave forensic traces inside native Windows logging systems.

🧰 Tools Used
Windows Event Viewer

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🖥 Step 1 – Monitoring Process Creation (Event ID 4688)
In Event Viewer:
Navigated to Windows Logs → Security
Applied filter for:
Event ID: 4688
Purpose: Displays all newly created processes

Helps detect suspicious executables, scripts, or malware launches

📂 Step 2 – Tracking Object Access (Event ID 4663)
Filtered logs using:
Event ID: 4663
Purpose: Monitors file and folder access
Detects unauthorized reads, writes, or modifications
Commonly used to spot: Data exfiltration & Malware modifying system files

🌐 Step 3 – Monitoring Network Connections (Event ID 5156)
Applied filter:
Event ID: 5156
Purpose: Displays inbound and outbound network connections & Identifies suspicious IP addresses and unexpected ports
Useful for detecting: Command & Control traffic, Malware beaconing, Lateral movement

🗑 Step 4 – Detecting Deleted Objects (Event ID 4660)
Filtered logs:
Event ID: 4660
Purpose: Tracks deleted files or objects, Helps detect log tampering or evidence removal, Often associated with attacker 
cleanup activity.

🔍 Findings
Process execution activities were traceable via Event ID 4688
File access attempts were clearly logged under Event ID 4663
Network communications were visible through Event ID 5156
Object deletion actions were recorded under Event ID 4660
➡️ Windows Event Logs provide critical forensic evidence of attacker behavior.

📚 Lessons Learned
Native Windows logging is a powerful forensic resource
Specific Event IDs map directly to attacker techniques
Filtering logs dramatically speeds up investigations
Process, network, and file activity together reveal full attack chains
Event Viewer is essential for SOC and DFIR operations
