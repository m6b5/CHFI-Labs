🎯 Objective
Understand how to statically analyze a suspicious PDF document by:
Parsing embedded objects and streams
Identifying malicious JavaScript elements
Detecting automatic execution triggers
Scanning for known PDF exploits
All analysis is performed without opening the PDF file, preventing accidental execution.

🧰 Tools Used
Didier Stevens Suite:
-pdfid.py
-pdf-parser.py
PDF Stream Dumper (GUI)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔍 Step 1 – Initial PDF Suspicion Scan (pdfid.py)
Used the Python-based tool:
python pdfid.py Infected.pdf

Purpose:
Identify suspicious keywords commonly used in malicious PDFs

Key findings from output:
/JS and /JavaScript → Embedded JavaScript code
/OpenAction → Automatic execution when the PDF is opened
➡️ These indicators strongly suggest malicious intent.

🧱 Step 2 – Object-Level Analysis (pdf-parser.py)
Executed:
python pdf-parser.py Infected.pdf

Analysis revealed:
Object 1 0 references object 5 0 R
Object 5 0 contains the OpenAction functionality
-->This confirms that JavaScript is executed automatically when the document is opened.

🧵 Step 3 – Deep Inspection Using PDF Stream Dumper (GUI)
Launched PDF Stream Dumper
Clicked Load → PDF File
Selected Infected.pdf

Observations:
All PDF objects are listed in the interface
Objects are color-coded based on type

Color legend accessed via:
Tools → About Listview Colors

🧠 Step 4 – JavaScript Analysis
Within the parsed objects, the following was observed:
Presence of util.printf() JavaScript function

Security significance:
Commonly found in malicious Adobe PDF exploits
Can be abused to gather system information
Often used in exploit delivery chains

☠️ Step 5 – Exploit Detection Scan
Clicked Exploit_Scan in the toolbar
Tool scanned the PDF for known exploit signatures
Results displayed in a generated text file
For vulnerability research and confirmation:
CVE reference database: https://cve.mitre.org

🔍 Findings
The PDF file contains embedded JavaScript
Automatic execution is triggered via /OpenAction
Object relationships confirm hidden malicious behavior
Known malicious JavaScript functions are present
The file can be analyzed safely without execution
➡️ This PDF exhibits characteristics of malicious document-based malware.

📚 Lessons Learned
PDF files can contain complex malicious logic
Static analysis prevents accidental compromise
pdfid.py is ideal for quick triage
pdf-parser.py exposes object relationships
GUI tools help visualize exploit chains
PDF malware is a common initial infection vector
