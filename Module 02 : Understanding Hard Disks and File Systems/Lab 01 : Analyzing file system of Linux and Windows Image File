## 🎯 Objective
- Develop knowledge of hard disk types and file systems used in digital devices  
- Learn to perform file system analysis using Autopsy  
- Determine key information from file systems, including:  
  - File system type  
  - Metadata information (timestamps, ownership, permissions)  
  - File content information  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Autopsy** – digital forensics platform for analyzing disk and mobile images  

## 📌 Procedure
1. Open the target disk image in Autopsy  
2. Examine the file system structure to identify the type (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, exFAT)  
3. Navigate directories and inspect metadata of selected files  
4. Identify recently deleted or modified files and their metadata  
5. Document the hierarchy, file properties, and notable findings for further analysis  

## 🔍 Findings
- Deleted or modified files identified and logged for analysis  
- Any suspicious activity, anomalies, or file extension mismatches observed  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Understanding file system types is essential for forensic investigations  
- Metadata analysis helps determine timeline, ownership, and authenticity of files  
- Recovering deleted data and detecting file extension mismatch labs are covered in Module 05 Defeating Anti-forensics Techniques.
