## 🎯 Objective
- Understand how digital files are represented in hexadecimal format  
- Learn how to analyze popular file formats using a hex viewer  
- Identify file signatures (magic numbers) used in forensic investigations  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Hex Editor Neo** – hexadecimal file analysis and editing tool  

## 📌 Procedure

1. Launch Hex Editor Neo  
2. Navigate to:
File → Open → Open File

3. Select a target file (e.g., JPG, PDF, EXE, DOCX)  
4. Observe the hexadecimal representation of the file contents  
5. Identify file header signatures located at the beginning of the file  

## 🔍 Findings
- Each file format begins with a unique hexadecimal signature (magic number)  
- These signatures help identify file types even if extensions are changed  
- Example:
- JPG files typically start with `FF D8 FF`  
- PDF files start with `25 50 44 46`  
- Hex analysis allows detection of disguised or tampered files  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Hexadecimal representation is the lowest-level view of digital data  
- File signatures are critical in forensic validation and recovery  
- Hex editors help uncover hidden data and file manipulation  
- This technique is essential for detecting anti-forensics techniques
