## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how to recover permanently deleted files from a forensic disk image using WinHex  
- Understand file header–based recovery techniques used in digital investigations  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **WinHex** – advanced hex editor and forensic data recovery tool  

## 📌 Procedure

1. Open WinHex and load the forensic image:
File → Open → Evidence.img


2. Navigate to:
Tools → Disk Tools → File Recovery by Type


3. In the **File Header Search** window:
- Select file types to be recovered (JPG, PDF, DOCX, etc.)

4. When prompted:
- Create a recovery folder on the Desktop named **Retrieved_Files**

5. Start the recovery process:
- WinHex scans the disk image and extracts recoverable files into the selected folder

## 🔍 Findings
- WinHex successfully recovered multiple file types based on file signature analysis  
- Deleted files remained retrievable despite removal from the file system structure  
- Header-based carving allows recovery even when metadata is missing  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Permanent deletion does not immediately erase data from storage media  
- File signature analysis is an effective forensic recovery technique  
- WinHex provides powerful low-level access for forensic investigations and data carving  
- Proper evidence handling using disk images preserves original data integrity
