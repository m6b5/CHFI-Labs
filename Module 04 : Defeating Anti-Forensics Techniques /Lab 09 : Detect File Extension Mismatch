🎯 Objective
Attackers frequently disguise malicious files by changing their file extensions (e.g., .exe renamed to .jpg or .pdf) to evade detection and trick users.

This lab focuses on:
✔ Identifying tampered file extensions
✔ Comparing visible extensions with true file types
✔ Detecting hidden malicious content in disk images

🧰 Tools Used
Autopsy Forensic Suite

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
📂 Part 1 — Loading the Forensic Image
Open Autopsy
Add evidence file: XX.dd
When the Configure Ingest Modules window appears, enable:
✅ File Type Identification
✅ Extension Mismatch Detector
✅ Embedded File Extractor
Start ingestion and allow analysis to complete

🔍 Part 2 — Reviewing Extension Mismatches
In the left pane, navigate to:
Results → Extension Mismatch Detected
Review flagged files in the right pane:
Extension column → visible (modified) extension
MIME Type column → actual file format
➡ Differences indicate tampering or obfuscation

🔍 Findings
✔ Multiple files displayed mismatched extensions
✔ MIME analysis revealed true underlying file types
✔ Several files were disguised to appear harmless
✔ Evidence of file obfuscation and evasion techniques

📚 Lessons Learned
File extensions alone cannot be trusted
MIME type analysis reveals real file structure
Attackers commonly disguise executables and scripts

Extension mismatch detection is critical in malware investigation
