🎯 Objective
Understand how file carving behaves on Solid State Drives (SSD) by:
Recovering deleted files from unallocated disk space
Observing the impact of the TRIM command on forensic recovery
Comparing evidence acquisition when TRIM is enabled vs disabled
Demonstrating real-world anti-forensics techniques

🧰 Tools Used
Autopsy Digital Forensics Platform

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔍 Step 1 — File Carving on TRIM-Enabled SSD Image
Loaded forensic image:
XX_TE.dd
Configured ingest modules (default settings).
Autopsy attempted file carving.
📉 Result:
No files were recovered.
➡ Demonstrates that TRIM permanently clears unallocated space, preventing recovery.

🗂 Step 2 — File Carving on TRIM-Disabled SSD Image
Loaded forensic image:
XX_TD.dd
Allowed Autopsy to process and carve deleted content.
Navigated to:
CarvedFiles directory
Deleted Files → All
Reviewed:
File contents
Hex data
Metadata
Text representations

🔍 Findings
✔ TRIM-enabled SSD prevents file carving
✔ TRIM-disabled SSD allows recovery of deleted data
✔ Demonstrates effective anti-forensics technique
✔ Confirms SSD behavior differs from HDD forensics

📚 Lessons Learned
File carving relies on unallocated disk space
TRIM wipes data blocks permanently
SSDs significantly reduce post-deletion recovery
Anti-forensics must be considered in investigations
