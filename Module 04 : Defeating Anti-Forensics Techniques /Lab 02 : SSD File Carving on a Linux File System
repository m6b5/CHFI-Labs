🎯 Objective
Learn how to recover deleted files from a Linux-based SSD forensic image by:
Performing file carving on unallocated space
Analyzing carved artifacts from Linux file systems
Understanding SSD behavior in forensic recovery scenarios

🧰 Tools Used
Autopsy Digital Forensics Platform

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
📂 Step 1 — Load Linux SSD Forensic Image
Opened forensic image:
Linux_SSD.dd
Observed structured directories representing:
System files
Process data
Service artifacts
Application traces

🔍 Step 2 — Perform File Carving
Allowed Autopsy ingest modules to process the image.
Navigated to:
CarvedFiles
in the results pane.
Reviewed recovered files and associated metadata.

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully carved deleted files from Linux SSD image
✔ Retrieved file fragments from unallocated space
✔ Verified recovery of Linux filesystem artifacts
✔ Demonstrated SSD carving capability when TRIM is not enforced

📚 Lessons Learned
File carving works on Linux file systems similar to Windows
SSD recovery depends on TRIM configuration
Autopsy supports multi-OS forensic analysis

Linux forensic artifacts are valuable evidence sources
