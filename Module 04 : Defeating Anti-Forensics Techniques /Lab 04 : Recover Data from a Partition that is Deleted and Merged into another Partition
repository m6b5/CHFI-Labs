🎯 Objective
Understand how to recover data from a partition that has been:
Deleted
Merged into another active partition
Hidden within extended disk space
And how forensic tools can reconstruct the original partition structure.

🧰 Tools Used
Windows Disk Management
R-Studio Data Recovery

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
💽 Step 1 — Simulate Partition Merging (Anti-Forensics Technique)
Opened:
Disk Management → Create and format hard disk partitions
Right-clicked Forensic Disk partition → Selected:
Extend Volume
Followed Extend Volume Wizard → merged deleted partition space into active partition.
Result:
Original deleted partition space became part of a larger partition.

🔍 Step 2 — Scan for Hidden/Lost Partition
Launched R-Studio.
Selected the existing merged partition (F: drive).
Started scan using:
Detailed scan (slower but finds lost objects)

📂 Step 3 — Identify Reconstructed Partition
After scan completion:
Tool displayed Recognized Partition(s)
Found:
Recognized1 — 20 GB (Unknown space)
This corresponded to:
The deleted partition that had been merged into the 10 GB active partition
Combined volume appeared as 30 GB

♻ Step 4 — Recover Files
Double-clicked Recognized1.
Browsed recovered folders and files.
When prompted:
✔ Applied recovery settings to all files
✔ Continued recovery process

Recovered data stored at:
C:\Recovered Partition\Root

🔍 Findings
✔ Hidden merged partition successfully detected
✔ Original deleted volume reconstructed
✔ Files fully recovered
✔ Disk merging does NOT securely erase data

📚 Lessons Learned
Merging partitions does not destroy original data
Forensic tools can detect unknown space structures
Partition reconstruction is possible even after volume extension
Common anti-forensics techniques are ineffective against deep scans
