🎯 Objective
Understand how Windows authentication stores credentials using:
LM (LAN Manager) hashes
NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) hashes
And learn how forensic investigators can:
Extract password hashes from a compromised system
Use them for further analysis or password cracking during investigations

🧰 Tools Used
pwdump7

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🖥 Step 1 — Launch with Administrative Privileges
Opened Command Prompt as Administrator:
Start → cmd → Run as administrator

📂 Step 2 — Navigate to pwdump7 Directory
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\pwdump7

🔐 Step 3 — Dump Password Hashes
Executed:
PwDump.exe
Tool extracted:
LM hashes
NTLM hashes
Directly from Windows SAM database.

🔎 Step 4 — Post-Extraction Use
Extracted hashes can later be analyzed with tools such as:
John the Ripper
Hashcat
Mimikatz
For password recovery or security auditing.

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully retrieved LM and NTLM password hashes
✔ Demonstrated how credentials can be extracted post-compromise
✔ Highlighted weakness of poor password policies

📚 Lessons Learned
Windows credentials can be extracted if system access is gained
NTLM hashes are valuable forensic artifacts
Strong passwords & credential protection are critical
Hash extraction is a common attacker and investigator technique
