🎯 Objective
Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a feature of the NTFS file system that allows files to contain hidden data streams in addition to their main content.
Attackers abuse ADS to:
Hide malicious payloads
Store sensitive data covertly
Bypass traditional file inspection

This lab focuses on:
✔ Detecting hidden NTFS streams
✔ Extracting concealed data
✔ Understanding ADS as an anti-forensics technique

🧰 Tools Used
Windows PowerShell (Administrator)
NoVirusThanks Stream Detector

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🖥️ Part 1 — Detecting ADS Using PowerShell
Launch Windows PowerShell as Administrator
Navigate to system directory:
cd C:\Windows\System32
Scan recursively for hidden streams:
gci -recurse | % { gi $_.FullName -stream * } | where stream -ne ':$Data'
➡ Lists files containing Alternate Data Streams

In real-world attacks, ADS are attached to normal-looking files to evade suspicion.

📤 Part 2 — Extracting Hidden ADS Content
To view data stored inside a hidden stream:
get-content -path C:\Windows\System32\file.txt -stream secret_file1.txt
➡ Displays the concealed data from the ADS stream

🔍 Part 3 — Detecting ADS Using Stream Detector Tool
Launch NoVirusThanks Stream Detector
Select directory to scan (example: C:\Windows\System32)
Start scan
➡ Tool lists:
Stream name
Host file
Stream size

🔍 Findings
✔ Hidden Alternate Data Streams were detected using PowerShell and GUI tool
✔ Concealed data was successfully extracted
✔ ADS can store information invisibly from normal file explorers
✔ Legitimate files can be weaponized as covert containers

📚 Lessons Learned
NTFS ADS is a powerful anti-forensics technique
Hidden data does not alter visible file size or behavior
PowerShell can uncover stealth persistence mechanisms
ADS should always be checked during forensic investigations
