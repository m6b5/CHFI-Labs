🎯 Objective
Understand how attackers and insiders:
Hide data inside images and audio files using steganography
Evade detection by embedding malicious or sensitive content
Use covert channels for data exfiltration
Learn how to:
✔ Detect steganographic techniques
✔ Extract hidden files from media
✔ Analyze embedded content

🧰 Tools Used
StegSpy — Steganography detection
OpenStego — Data extraction from images
zsteg (Linux) — Advanced PNG analysis
DeepSound — Audio steganography extraction

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🖼️ Part 1 — Detecting Steganography with StegSpy
Launch StegSpy
Upload image file XX.png
Scan file
➡ Tool identifies the steganographic method used to embed hidden data

📤 Part 2 — Extracting Hidden Data from Image with OpenStego
Launch OpenStego
Click Extract Data under Data Hiding
Select XX.png as carrier file
Provide output path
Start extraction
➡ Hidden file is successfully recovered

🧪 Part 3 — Advanced Image Analysis Using zsteg (Linux)
Open terminal
Gain root privileges
sudo su
apt update
apt install ruby -y
gem install zsteg
zsteg XX.png
➡ Embedded hidden information is revealed within PNG file

🎧 Part 4 — Extracting Hidden Audio Data Using DeepSound
Launch DeepSound
Click Open Carrier Files
Select XX.wav
Click Extract Secret Files
➡ Tool extracts hidden audio-embedded data and displays file location

🔍 Findings
✔ Steganography techniques were detected in image and audio files
✔ Hidden files were successfully extracted from PNG and WAV formats
✔ Embedded content can carry sensitive data or malicious payloads
✔ Steganography can bypass traditional security controls if unchecked

📚 Lessons Learned
Media files can be covert data carriers
Steganography is actively used in cybercrime and malware campaigns
Detection requires specialized forensic tools
Hidden data extraction is critical in DFIR investigations
