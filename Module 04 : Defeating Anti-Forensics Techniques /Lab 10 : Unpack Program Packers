🎯 Objective
Malware authors frequently use packers to compress and obfuscate executables in order to:
Evade antivirus detection
Hide malicious code
Complicate static analysis

This lab focuses on:
✔ Identifying packed executable files
✔ Determining the packer used
✔ Safely unpacking the executable for further analysis

🧰 Tools Used
Detect It Easy (DiE)
ExeInfo PE
UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables)
Windows PowerShell / Command Prompt

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔍 Step 1 — Identify the Packer Using Detect It Easy (DiE)
Launch Detect It Easy (DiE)
Load the suspicious file: XX.exe
Review detection results in the main window

Observed Output:
Packer/compiler identified
Entropy level indicating compression/obfuscation
➡ Confirms executable is packed

🔍 Step 2 — Cross-Verification Using ExeInfo PE
Launch ExeInfo PE
Load XX.exe
Analyze packer signature
Result:
File identified as packed with UPX
⚠️ Packers are commonly used by malware to evade detection

📦 Step 3 — Unpack the Executable Using UPX
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in UPX directory
Run:
upx.exe -d -o "E:\Path\Unpacked.exe" "E:\Path\XX.exe"
Verify successful unpacking
➡ Clean unpacked executable generated

🔍 Findings
✔ Executable was packed using UPX
✔ Packing successfully detected by DiE and ExeInfo PE
✔ File unpacked successfully for deeper analysis
✔ Original code now accessible for static inspection

📚 Lessons Learned
Packed malware hides real malicious logic
Packer detection is essential before static analysis
UPX is commonly abused by attackers
Unpacking restores readable executable structure
