## 🎯 Objective
- Understand the importance of creating duplicate copies of hard disks for forensic analysis  
- Learn to create a disk image of a hard disk partition using R-Drive Image  
- Ensure the original evidence remains unaltered during investigation  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **R-Drive Image** – disk imaging tool used to create exact copies of partitions for forensic purposes  

## 📌 Procedure
1. Launch R-Drive Image and select **Create Image**  
2. Choose the partition to image (e.g., `C:`)  
3. In the **Partition Selection** window, confirm the target partition  
4. Select the **Image Destination** where the disk image will be stored  
5. Click **Start** to begin the disk imaging process   

## 🔍 Findings
- Disk images provide an exact, forensically sound copy of the original partition  
- Creating an image ensures that the original evidence is preserved and unaltered  
- Imaging is a crucial first step before performing any forensic analysis  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Always perform investigations on disk images, not the original hard disk  
- Disk imaging is essential for maintaining chain-of-custody and evidence integrity  
- Examination of disk image Files is Covered in CHFIv11 Module 06: Windows Forensics
