## 🎯 Objective
- Understand the use of hash functions for file integrity verification  
- Compute hashes for files and text strings  
- Check file hashes on VirusTotal to determine if files are malicious  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **HashCalc** – computes MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and other hash values  
- **VirusTotal** – online service to check files or hashes against known malware  

## 📌 Procedure
1. Select a suspicious file for analysis  
2. Use HashCalc to compute the file's MD5 hash  
3. Submit the hash (or file) to VirusTotal  
4. Analyze the results for malware detection  

## 🔍 Findings
- Hash values uniquely identify files and can be used to track their presence in databases  
- VirusTotal provided information about whether the file is known to be malicious  
- Hashing is faster and safer than uploading all files directly for analysis  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Hashing is a critical forensic technique for verifying file integrity and identifying threats  
- Online malware scanning services like VirusTotal are valuable for quick verification of suspicious files  
- Investigators should always record hash values as part of digital evidence documentation
