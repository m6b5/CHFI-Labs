🎯 Objective
Analyze SSH logs to identify failed login attempts and potential brute-force attacks.

🧰 Tools Used
Ubuntu Terminal

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
1️⃣ List All Failed SSH Logins
grep "Failed password" auth.log
Displays all failed login attempts recorded in the auth.log file

2️⃣ Verify Failed SSH Attempts
cat auth.log | grep "Failed password"
Confirms the results from the previous command

3️⃣ Search for All Failure Indicators
egrep "Failed|Failure" auth.log
Retrieves additional failed login events or authentication errors

4️⃣ List IP Addresses of Failed Logins
grep "Failed password" auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | uniq -c | sort -nr
Counts and sorts the IP addresses of clients that failed SSH authentication
Provides insight into potential brute-force attackers

🔍 Findings
Identified IP addresses attempting unauthorized SSH access
Frequency of failed attempts indicates possible brute-force attempts

📚 Lessons Learned
Linux command-line tools (grep, awk, egrep) are essential for log analysis
Counting and sorting IP addresses helps identify the most aggressive attackers
SSH logs are a key source of network forensic evidence
