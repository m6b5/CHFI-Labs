🎯 Objective
Examine network traffic logs to identify artifacts related to malicious activities and attacker behavior.

🧰 Tools Used
Kiwi Log Viewer

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
📁 Analyze njRAT Network Traffic

Open Kiwi Log Viewer
Navigate to:
File → Open File
Load the file:
njRAT.csv

Examine communication patterns:
Observe traffic over port 5552 (default njRAT port)
Identify source and destination IP addresses

From the logs:
10.10.1.11 → 10.10.1.22 over port 5552
Indicates njRAT client running on 10.10.1.11 (attacker machine)

📁 Analyze FTP Brute-Force Logs
Open:
FTP_bruteforce.csv

Observe FTP response codes:
Response Code	Meaning
530	Login failed
331	Username accepted – password required
230	Login successful

Apply visual highlighting:
Options → Highlighting
Color-code responses to quickly identify failed vs successful attempts.

🔍 Findings
Persistent communication on port 5552 confirms njRAT remote control activity.
Multiple FTP failed logins followed by success indicate brute-force compromise.

📚 Lessons Learned
Default malware ports can quickly expose malicious tools like njRAT.
Log visualization improves rapid threat detection.
Correlating responses reveals attacker techniques.
