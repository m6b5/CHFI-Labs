🎯 Objective
Analyze network packet captures to identify artifacts of various network attacks:
Examine incoming and outgoing packets
Identify malicious activities such as plain-text credential leaks, DNS anomalies, FTP brute-force, SYN flooding, 
and ARP poisoning

🧰 Tools Used
Wireshark

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
1️⃣ Analyze HTTP Traffic
Open HTTP Traffic.pcapng in Wireshark
Apply filter to locate plain-text credentials:
http.request.method == POST
Examine POST requests for usernames and passwords

2️⃣ Detect DNS Anomalies
Open DNS Remote Shell.pcap
Filter traffic on port 53:
tcp.port == 53
Use Follow TCP Stream to inspect DNS query and response sequences

3️⃣ Analyze FTP Brute-Force
Open FTP Brute-Force.pcapng
Filter for failed logins:
ftp.response.code == 530
Filter for successful logins:
ftp.response.code == 230

4️⃣ Detect SYN Flooding
Open Syn Flooding.pcapng
Observe repeated [SYN] packets sent to the victim
Attacker does not acknowledge [SYN, ACK] and sends [RST] packets to continue flooding
Use I/O Graph for visualization:
Statistics → I/O Graph → TCP Errors
Confirm unusually high TCP packet volume via:
Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy

5️⃣ Detect ARP Poisoning
Open ARP Poisoning.pcapng
Check for duplicate IP addresses:
arp.duplicate-address-detected
Verify duplicate IP warning messages in the packet details pane

🔍 Findings
Plain-text credentials can be exposed in POST requests
DNS port anomalies may indicate remote shells or exfiltration
Multiple failed FTP logins followed by success indicate brute-force attempts
High-volume SYN packets with RST responses confirm SYN flooding
Duplicate ARP entries indicate ARP poisoning attempts

📚 Lessons Learned
Wireshark filters are essential for narrowing down attack artifacts
Visual tools like I/O Graphs help identify volumetric attacks
Correlating multiple network protocols provides a full view of an attack
ARP, DNS, and TCP anomalies are strong indicators of network compromise
