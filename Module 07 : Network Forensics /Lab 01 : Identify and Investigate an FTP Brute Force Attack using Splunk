🎯 Objective
Examine FTP login attempts in a SIEM tool to identify potential brute-force attacks.

🧰 Tools Used
Splunk Enterprise

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
Open the lab file: FTP_bruteforce.csv.

Examine the log entries for successful logins:
Response: 230 User logged in
Scroll through the logs to detect failed login attempts:
Response: 530 User cannot login

Analyze repeated failed login entries from the same source IP (e.g., 10.10.1.8) to the destination IP (e.g., 10.10.1.11)
to identify brute-force behavior.

Use filters to isolate the latest successful login event and correlate it with previous failed attempts.

Focus on fields such as Destination, extracted_Source, and Info to extract meaningful artifacts.

🔍 Findings
Multiple failed login attempts were observed from the same IP address.
A successful login followed multiple failed attempts, indicating a brute-force attack.

📚 Lessons Learned
Repeated failed login events are strong indicators of brute-force attacks.
SIEM tools help correlate multiple events to establish attack patterns.
Focusing on the latest log entries ensures accurate detection of successful intrusions.
