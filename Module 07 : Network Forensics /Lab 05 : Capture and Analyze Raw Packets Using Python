🎯 Objective
Gain practical knowledge of capturing and analyzing raw network packets programmatically using Python.

🧰 Tools Used

Ubuntu Terminal
Python
Pyshark library
Tshark

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
1️⃣ Prepare Python Script
Write the packet_capture.py script using Pyshark to capture network packets in real time.
Save and close the text editor.

2️⃣ Install Pyshark
pip install pyshark


3️⃣ Install Tshark
apt install tshark
If prompted “Do you want to continue?”, type y and press Enter.
If installation fails, run:
apt-get update
then retry the installation.
During the wireshark-common configuration prompt, select No and press Enter.

4️⃣ Run the Packet Capture Script
python3 packet_capture.py
The script will now capture live network packets and display them programmatically.

🔍 Findings
Captured network packets can be analyzed in real time for protocols, IP addresses, ports, and packet contents.

📚 Lessons Learned
Pyshark allows programmatic access to packet capture data.
Tshark provides the underlying packet capture functionality.
Python scripts can automate network monitoring and forensic packet analysis.
