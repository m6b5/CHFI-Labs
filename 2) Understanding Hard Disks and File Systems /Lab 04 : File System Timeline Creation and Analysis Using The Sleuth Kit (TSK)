## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how to generate a timeline of file system activities performed on a suspect machine  
- Understand how MAC times (Modified, Accessed, Changed, Created) are used in forensic investigations  

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **The Sleuth Kit (TSK)** – forensic file system analysis toolkit  
- **Strawberry Perl** – required to run mactime timeline scripts  

## 📌 Procedure

1. Open Command Prompt in the TSK binary directory:
path\The Sleuth Kit (TSK)\bin


2. Will gather the temporal data from the image file:
fls -m 63 "path\Evidence.dd"


3. Write this temporal data into a timeline body file:
fls -m 63 "path\Evidence.dd" > body.txt


4. Generate timeline using mactime:
perl mactime.pl -b body.txt -z EST5EDT > timeline.txt


## 🔍 Findings
- The `-m` argument outputs file data in a format compatible with timeline creation  
- Sector `63` represents the file system starting offset  
- The generated timeline displays:
- Date and time of activity  
- File size  
- MACB activity types  
- Permissions  
- User and group IDs  
- Inode numbers  
- File names  

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Timeline analysis helps reconstruct user activity and system events  
- MAC timestamps are critical in identifying file creation, modification, and access patterns  
- The Sleuth Kit enables detailed chronological reconstruction of forensic evidence  
- Timelines are essential for correlating events during investigations
