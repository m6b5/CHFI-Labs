🎯 Objective

Volatile memory often contains critical forensic artifacts such as:
Injected malware payloads
Decrypted files
Network artifacts
Credentials and runtime data

This lab demonstrates how to:
✔ Extract residual data from a Linux memory dump
✔ Recover files stored temporarily in RAM
✔ Analyze volatile evidence without executing malware

🧰 Tools Used

PhotoRec (TestDisk Suite)

Ubuntu Linux

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔑 Step 1 — Privilege Escalation
sudo su
Ensures full access to forensic image files.

🧰 Step 2 — Install Recovery Tool
apt install testdisk
(PhotoRec is bundled within TestDisk)

📥 Step 3 — Load Memory Dump
photorec Linux.mem
Initiates forensic carving on the RAM image.

📂 Step 4 — Partition Handling
Selected Proceed
Partition detected as Unknown (expected for memory dumps)
Chose Search

📁 Step 5 — File System Type
Selected:
Other (memory dumps have no structured filesystem)

💾 Step 6 — Evidence Output Directory
Navigated to target folder
Pressed C to confirm recovery path
Recovered artifacts stored in automatically generated directories.

🔍 Findings
✔ Successfully carved files from volatile memory
✔ Recovered temporary artifacts stored only in RAM
✔ Demonstrated that memory contains forensic evidence beyond disk data

Common recoverable items may include:
Images
Executables
Config files
Temporary documents
Malware fragments

📚 Lessons Learned
RAM contains valuable forensic evidence
Fileless attacks still leave recoverable artifacts
Memory carving complements disk forensics
Volatile evidence can reveal runtime malware behavior
