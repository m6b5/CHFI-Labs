🎯 Objective
Examine web server and attack logs to identify artifacts related to:
SQL Injection
Command Injection
Directory Traversal
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
using Python scripts for automated parsing and analysis.

🧰 Tools Used
Python

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
SQL Injection Detection
Apply an encoded filter in the Python script:
root%27%20%20union%20select
Press Enter to parse the logs.

Observe malicious queries such as:
GET /commandexec/example1.php?ip=127.0.0.1|cat+/etc/passwd
HTTP status code 200 indicates the request was successfully processed by the server.

Directory Traversal Analysis
Use Python script to parse logs for encoded directory traversal patterns.
Review entries in the terminal for suspicious path access attempts.

XSS Attack Detection
Parse XSS logs in the terminal.
Identify payload patterns in query strings.

🔍 Findings
Malicious queries detected in SQL Injection and Command Injection logs.
Directory traversal attempts observed with encoded paths.
XSS payloads identified in server logs.

📚 Lessons Learned
Python scripts automate parsing and highlight attack indicators efficiently.
Encoded payloads can bypass manual inspection; automated scanning is critical.
Combining logs from multiple sources provides a clearer picture of attack vectors.
