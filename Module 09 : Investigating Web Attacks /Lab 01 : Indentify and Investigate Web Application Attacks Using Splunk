🎯 Objective
Analyze web server and security logs using a SIEM platform to identify artifacts related to:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
SQL Injection
Directory Traversal
Command Injection
XML External Entity (XXE) attacks

🧰 Tools Used
Splunk (SIEM Platform)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
🔍 Detect XSS Attacks
Search for encoded script payloads:
%3c%2fscript%3e%3cbr

💉 Detect SQL Injection
Plain-text and encoded payloads:
' or 1=1--
%27%20or%201%3D1%2D%2D
root%27%20union%20select

📁 Detect Directory Traversal
Indicators:
../../../
%2E%2E%2F
..%2F

⚙ Detect Command Injection
Search:
|ifconfig
|cat


or:
|ifconfig sourcetype="Command Injection.log (Apache Logs)"
|cat sourcetype="Command Injection.log (Apache Logs)"

Evidence observed:
Pipe (|) operator combined with Linux shell commands

Access to sensitive file:
/etc/passwd
➡ Strong indicator of command injection exploitation

📄 Detect XXE Attacks
Encoded payloads:
xml=%3C!DOCTYPE
%3c!Entity

🔍 Findings
🔐 Common Encoded Values

🚨 Attack Indicators Identified
Attacker IP addresses
Timeline and frequency of attacks
Targeted web resources
Malicious payload patterns

HTTP Status Codes Observed:
403 → blocked attempts
302 → redirections
200 → successful exploitation

🧠 Key Observations
UNION SELECT targeting information_schema.tables → SQL Injection
Repeated POST requests to /wp-login.php → brute-force attempts
Access shift /wp-login.php → /wp-admin/ → privilege compromise
Multiple encoded traversal strings → directory traversal exploitation

📚 Lessons Learned
SIEM platforms enable fast correlation of multi-log attacks
Attackers heavily use URL encoding to evade detection
Timeline + payload analysis improves incident response
Web logs are critical forensic artifacts during breach investigations
