🎯 Objective
- Collect volatile information from a live Windows machine
- Identify active users, processes, shared resources, and network connections
- Understand the importance of live response before system shutdown

🧰 Tools Used
Windows Command Prompt
Sysinternals PsTools
logonsessions64.exe
NetworkOpenedFiles
Python (psutil library)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)

⏰ Capture System Time
date /t & time /t

👤 Identify Logged-On Users
Run:
PsLoggedon64.exe
Displays:
Local users
Users connected via network resources

🌐 View Active Network Sessions
net sessions
Shows IP addresses of connected systems.

🔑 Analyze Logon Sessions
logonsessions64.exe
logonsessions64.exe -p
Displays:
Active sessions
Processes linked to each user session

📂 Identify Open Shared Files
net file
Reveals:
Open shared resources
User accessing them
File locks

📊 View Network Accessed Files
Run NetworkOpenedFiles GUI to inspect:
Shared folders
File properties

🌍 Monitor Network Connections
netstat -ano
Displays:
Active connections
Ports
Associated process IDs

📈 Capture Network Usage (Python)
Steps:
Install Python
Install library:
pip install psutil
Run script to collect:
Bandwidth usage
Connection duration

🔍 Findings
Active user sessions were identified both locally and remotely
Open shared files revealed live data access
Network connections exposed running services and potential attacker activity
Python script provided real-time network usage metrics

📚 Lessons Learned
Volatile data must be collected first during incident response
Live systems contain critical evidence that disappears after shutdown
Combining native commands with forensic tools improves visibility
