🎯 Objective
Detect suspicious and malicious processes running on a live system
Analyze a RAM dump to retrieve forensic artifacts related to cyber incidents
Correlate process, network, file, and registry evidence

🧰 Tools Used
(FireEye)
Volatility Framework
Linux strings utility

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)

🔴 Memory Analysis Using Redline
Open Redline → Analyze Data → Load memory image (XX.mem)
Review:
Processes – active programs in RAM
Ports – network connections and linked processes
Hierarchical Processes – parent-child relationships
Timeline – event sequence

⚡ Memory Analysis Using Volatility
🧠 Identify System Profile
volatility -f XX.mem imageinfo
volatility -f XX.mem kdbgscan
Select the closest matching profile (e.g., Win2008R2SP0x64).

🌐 Analyze Network Connections
volatility -f XX.mem --profile=Win2008R2SP0x64 netscan
Reveals suspicious processes initiating multiple connections.

📋 List Running Processes
volatility -f XX.mem --profile=Win2008R2SP0x64 pslist

📁 Inspect Files Used by a Process
volatility -f XX.mem --profile=Win2008R2SP0x64 handles -p 1896 -t file

🗝 Inspect Registry Keys
volatility -f XX.mem --profile=Win2008R2SP0x64 handles -p 1896 -t key

🌳 View Process Tree
volatility -f XX.mem --profile=Win2008R2SP0x64 pstree

🔎 Additional Plugins Used
malfind
arp
ifconfig
lsof

🐧 Artifact Extraction Using Strings (Linux)
📂 Extract File Paths
strings XX.mem | grep -i "^[a-z]:\\\\" | sort | uniq

🌐 Extract URLs
strings XX.mem | egrep "^https?://" | sort | uniq

📡 Extract IP Addresses
strings XX.mem | egrep -oE '[0-9]{1,3}(\.[0-9]{1,3}){3}'

🎯 Filter Specific IP
strings XX.mem | egrep "172.20.20.9"

🔍 Findings
Suspicious processes repeatedly initiated network connections
Hidden artifacts recovered from memory dump
Associated files and registry keys identified
Network indicators extracted for threat correlation

📚 Lessons Learned
RAM contains critical evidence not stored on disk
Memory forensics is essential for malware detection
Process relationships reveal attack execution flow
Combining GUI and CLI tools improves investigation accuracy
