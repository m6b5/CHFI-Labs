🎯 Objective
Learn how to view, monitor, and analyze Windows event logs
Detect suspicious activity such as failed login attempts

🧰 Tools Used
Event Log Explorer (elex_setup.exe)

📌 Procedure (Key Steps)
Install Event Log Explorer
Click Open Event Log File → select XX.evtx
The application loads the log entries in the right pane

🔍 Analyzing Events
Select an event → Description pane displays details
Scroll through logs → identify Audit Failure events
Double-click an Audit Failure → opens Event Properties → reveals failed login attempt
Compare timestamps of Audit Failure and Audit Success events → helps detect possible brute-force attacks

🔍 Findings
Multiple Audit Failure events indicate failed login attempts
Corresponding Audit Success events after failures can signal successful brute-force attempts

📚 Lessons Learned
Event Log Explorer is useful for monitoring and investigating system activity
Security events (failures and successes) can reveal attack patterns
Understanding timestamps and event sequences is crucial in forensic analysis
